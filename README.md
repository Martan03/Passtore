# Passtore
Passtore is app created in .NET MAUI (therefore it's multiplatform). Purpose of this app is to store passwords.

When you start the app for the first time, you will need to set the password to access your passwords (this sounds silly :) ). With this password you will be able to access the app in later usage.

After you're granted access, you'll se All passwords page. But bit empty :). To add password you have to click '+' icon in the top right corner.
